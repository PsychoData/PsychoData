### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on [msportals.io](https://msportals.io) - a site that lists Microsoft Portals in an easily searchable format. 

I have been blogging at [SysManSquad](https://sysmansquad.com/author/psychodata91gmail-com/) and [contoso.one](https://contoso.one). 
I work in IT at a Managed Services Provider, thoroughly enjoy PowerShell, and work a lot with Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Azure, and Security around those. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me most of the time on the [WinAdmins Discord](https://discord.com/invite/winadmins) at [@PsychoData](https://discordapp.com/users/264652399824601088). 

You can also reach me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevincrouch4/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psychodata), though I won't see those areas as frequently.
